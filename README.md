## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned to start the project by doing the mobile view first and progressively adding complexity for bigger screens.

```css
@media (min-width: 700px) {
  body {
    padding: 4rem;
  }
  .recipe {
    border-radius: var(--border-radius-md);
    padding: 2rem;
  }
  .recipe__image {
    border-radius: var(--border-radius-sm);
  }
}
```

### Continued development
On future projects I want to focus more on responsive design, using flexbox and grid.


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - I learned a lot about responsive layouts and flexbox from Kevin Powell's youtube channel.
